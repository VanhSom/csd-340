    <h2>"The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
    <h3>The First Three Stanzas:</h3>
    
    <p>Once upon a midnight <span id="word1">______</span>, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
        Only this and nothing more.”
    </p>

    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
        From my books <span id="word2">______</span> of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Nameless here for evermore
    </p>

    <button onclick="replaceWord('word2', 'surcease')">surcease</button>
        
    <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain <span id="word3">______</span> rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        So that now, to still the beating of my <span id="word4">______</span> heart, I stood repeating
        “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        This it is and nothing more.”
    </P>
